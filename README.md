# SoundCloud UWP App (Ad-free)

## Disclaimer
This is the official SoundCloud Xbox app, downloaded as an APPX. It runs almost perfectly on Windows.

**No code is edited, this file was directly pulled from the MS Store (It is signed by Microsoft too). It is ad-free because of a bug and can be fixed at anytime by SoundCloud (if this bug is server-side, otherwise it will stay forever <3).**

I uploaded this here to make it more available for download, since you can't find the original SoundCloud APPXBundle file online.

### Compatibility
Should work with all UWP-compatible devices. Tested on Xbox and Windows 11.

### Known Bugs
Currently there were no app-breaking bugs found. Please note that Bugs wont be fixed because the App is made by SoundCloud themselves.

**Windows:**
- Volume Slider **sometimes** disappears on playing now screen (usually not a problem)
- Theres no blurred cover background
- Text can be highlighted
